# scGUI, formerly scAnWr

scGUI is a native macOS app (SwiftUI) that wraps Scanpy via a bundled Python backend, so end users can download and run without installing Python.

Project state is stored under a single `.scanwr/` folder inside the project directory.

Developer docs live in `mac/ScanwrMac/README.md`.
