# scGUI, formerly scAnWr

scGUI is a native macOS app (SwiftUI) that wraps Scanpy via a bundled Python backend, so end users can download and run without installing Python.

Project state is stored under a single `.scanwr/` folder inside the project directory (including the current workflow in `.scanwr/template.json`).

## Release

- Current version: `0.1.1`
- Build outputs: `mac/ScanwrMac/dist/scGUI.app` and `mac/ScanwrMac/dist/scGUI-0.1.1.dmg`

Developer docs live in `mac/ScanwrMac/README.md`.
